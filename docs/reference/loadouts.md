# Loadouts

A loadout is a per-developer bundle of packages, environment variables, file
patches, and lifecycle hooks that the [`min` session CLI](./cli-min.md) layers
into the sessions it activates. The project's
[`minimal.toml`](./minimal-dot-toml.md) describes what every contributor's
session needs; a loadout carries what *you* want on top (your editor,
terminal multiplexer, shell config, and dotfiles) so each development
environment comes up matching your muscle memory.

Loadouts apply to sessions (`min session activate`); they are not used by task
sandboxes, which have their own `packages`/`env_vars`/`patches` schema
described in [Tasks](./tasks.md).

## Where loadouts live

Each loadout is a single TOML file at:

```
<config>/minimal/loadouts/<name>.toml
```

`<config>` is the platform user config directory: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` on Linux
(or `$HOME/.config` when unset); macOS also uses `$HOME/.config` for
consistency with Minimal's state and cache dirs. The global
[`--config-dir`](./cli-min.md#global-flags) flag overrides the base, and
`min dirs` prints the resolved loadouts directory.

The filename stem **is** the loadout's identifier:

- It must match the `name` field declared inside the file, or loading fails
  with a `NameMismatch` error naming both the file stem and the declared
  `name`.
- Names are trimmed and must be non-empty, with no `/`, `\`, or NUL
  characters.

The directory is not created automatically; create it and drop
`<name>.toml` files there to get started.

## Example

A loadout that brings in the helix editor and zellij multiplexer, wired up
with the user's dotfiles:

```toml
name        = "dev"
description = "helix + zellij with my dotfiles"
packages    = ["helix", "zellij"]

patches = [
    # Helix: single config files plus a themes directory.
    { dest = ".config/helix/config.toml", source = "~/dotfiles/helix/config.toml" },
    { dest = ".config/helix/languages.toml", source = "~/dotfiles/helix/languages.toml" },
    { dest = ".config/helix/themes/", source = "~/dotfiles/helix/themes/**/*.toml" },

    # Zellij: single config file plus a layouts directory.
    { dest = ".config/zellij/config.kdl", source = "~/dotfiles/zellij/config.kdl" },
    { dest = ".config/zellij/layouts/", source = "~/dotfiles/zellij/layouts/**/*.kdl" },
]

[vars]
EDITOR    = "hx"
VISUAL    = "hx"

# Declared to warm helix's tree-sitter grammar cache when the session
# comes up. Best-effort; failures don't tank activation.
[[lifecycle_hooks]]
on_activate = { type = "inline", value = "hx --grammar fetch >/dev/null 2>&1 || true" }
```

Saved as `<config>/minimal/loadouts/dev.toml`, this is applied with
`min session activate --loadout dev`, or automatically via
[`default_loadouts`](#client-config).

## Loadout schema

### `name` - The loadout's identifier

_Required_

Must match the filename stem. Shown in selection and error messages.

```toml
name = "dev"
```

### `description` - Describe the loadout

_Optional_

Free-form text, shown alongside the name in `min loadout list`.

```toml
description = "Editor + terminal multiplexer"
```

### `packages` - Packages to bring into the session

_Optional_

Package names installed into the session, in addition to the session's
baseline packages and anything the project contributes. Duplicates across
contributors are deduplicated.

```toml
packages = ["helix", "zellij"]
```

Names are not checked at activation: an unknown package composes cleanly
and fails later, when the session first spawns, with
`no such package: <name>`.

### `[vars]` - Environment variables

_Optional_

Variables set in the session environment. Names must be POSIX-shaped
(`[A-Z_][A-Z0-9_]*`); for other names, see
[`[[vars_lenient]]`](#vars_lenient). Each value takes one of three forms:

```toml
[vars]
EDITOR = "hx"                                # literal value
PAGER   = { inherit = true, default = "less" }  # inherit, with fallback
MUXER = { inherit = true }               # inherit from the host env
```

- A **literal** string sets the variable to that value.
- `{ inherit = true }` passes the variable through from the environment of
  the `min` process on the host. If the host does not have it set, the
  variable is dropped from the session (with a warning) rather than failing
  activation, so opportunistically inheriting things like `TERM` is safe.
- `{ inherit = true, default = "..." }` inherits, falling back to `default`
  when the host does not have the variable set.

`inherit = false` is rejected; omit the variable instead.

### `[[vars_lenient]]` - Environment variables with non-POSIX names {#vars_lenient}

_Optional_

An explicit opt-in for the rare variable whose name is not POSIX-shaped.
Anything the Linux kernel accepts is allowed (no `=`, no NUL). Values use
the same three forms as `[vars]`.

```toml
[[vars_lenient]]
name  = "weird-thing"
value = "x"
```

### `patches` - Files copied from the host into the session

_Optional_

Each row names a `source` on the host and a `dest` inside the session,
with an optional `description`.

```toml
patches = [
    { dest = ".psqlrc", source = "~/dotfiles/psqlrc" },
    { dest = "certs/",    source = "~/ca/*.pem" },
    { dest = ".config/nvim/", source = "~/dotfiles/nvim/**/*.lua" },
]
```

**`source`** is a host path or glob pattern, or a list of them (a list
fans out into one independent patch per entry, each sharing the `dest` --
so list entries only make sense with per-entry dests or glob entries):

- A leading `~` expands to the host home directory. `$NAME` / `${NAME}`
  references (including `$HOME`) resolve against the session's
  already-resolved variables (declared in `[vars]`); referencing an
  undefined name is an error. `$$` is a literal `$`.
- After expansion the path must be absolute; anchor home-relative sources
  with `~/`.
- Glob patterns must have a literal directory prefix to walk from:
  `~/dotfiles/**/*.lua` is fine, a bare `**/*.pem` is rejected.
- `..` components are rejected wherever they appear.
- A source path that does not exist on the host is dropped with a warning
  at activation rather than failing it, so opportunistically patching a
  dotfile tree the host may not have is safe. Other enumeration failures
  (permission denied, unreadable entries) still fail the composition.

**`dest`** is interpreted relative to the session user's home directory.
Absolute paths and `..` components are rejected. For a literal (non-glob)
source, `dest` is used verbatim as the destination file path; for glob
sources, `dest` is the destination directory and each match's path under
the walk root is appended to it.

By default the walker does not follow symlinks while enumerating glob
matches; see [`follow_symlinks`](#follow_symlinks) and the
[client config](#client-config).

### `[[lifecycle_hooks]]` - Scripts at session transition points

_Optional_

Each hook groups up to three scripts (`on_activate`, `on_destroy`, and
`on_failure`), and at least one must be present. An optional `description`
labels the hook. Scripts are either inline or a path to a file:

```toml
[[lifecycle_hooks]]
description = "warm caches"
on_activate = { type = "inline",   value = "cargo fetch || true" }
on_failure  = { type = "external", value = "./cleanup.sh" }
```

External script paths must be relative (absolute paths are rejected at
parse time) and are anchored to the configuration directory the file was
loaded from. Hooks from multiple contributors concatenate in declaration
order. Note: in the current release hooks are composed and recorded with
the session, but executing them is not yet wired up.

### `follow_symlinks` - Symlink handling for patch sources {#follow_symlinks}

_Optional_

Overrides the client-wide `[loadouts].follow_symlinks` setting (see
[client config](#client-config)) for this loadout's patches only. When
unset, the client-wide setting applies.

```toml
follow_symlinks = true
```

## Selecting loadouts at activation

[`min session activate`](./cli-min.md#session-activate) decides which loadouts to apply
from two flags:

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--loadout <NAME>` | Apply `<config>/minimal/loadouts/<NAME>.toml`. Repeatable. If given, the config file's `default_loadouts` are ignored |
| `--no-loadouts` | Apply no loadouts at all. Conflicts with `--loadout` |

Resolution order:

1. `--no-loadouts`: nothing is applied, regardless of configuration.
2. One or more `--loadout NAME`: exactly the named loadouts are applied.
3. Neither flag: the `[loadouts].default_loadouts` list from the
   [client config](#client-config) is applied.
4. Neither flag and an empty `default_loadouts`: the
   [built-in `default` loadout](#built-in-default-loadout) is applied,
   unless a user `default.toml` shadows it.

Loadouts are resolved and composed **before** the CLI contacts the daemon:
a missing or malformed loadout file fails the activation loudly on the
client rather than producing a silently-empty session. When loadouts are
applied, the CLI prints `Applying loadouts: <names>` to stderr.

Activation is also when loadout contents are captured: the files are read
once, inherited vars are resolved against the host environment, and the
composed result is what the session runs with. Editing a loadout file
does not change sessions that already exist; destroy and re-activate to
pick up the edit.

## Built-in default loadout {#built-in-default-loadout}

When a session is activated with no loadout flags and an empty
`default_loadouts`, a built-in `default` loadout applies so a fresh box
comes up oriented rather than in a bare shell. It contributes **no
packages** — only a shaped `PS1` and a once-only banner (the minimal
mark, the [orientation lines](#orientation-banner) naming the session
and its loadouts, plus a pointer to `min add`), shipped through the
[MOTD recipe](#vars-in-the-attach-shell). The banner is TTY-gated, prints
exactly once per session, and renders without color.

It is the lowest-precedence source: `--no-loadouts`, `--loadout`, and a
non-empty `default_loadouts` all take priority, and a user
`default.toml` in the loadouts directory shadows it entirely (the file
is applied in its place). `min loadout list` shows it as a
`default (built-in)` row unless that user file is present.

## Client config {#client-config}

Client-wide loadout preferences live in `<config>/minimal/config.toml`,
under a `[loadouts]` section:

```toml
[loadouts]
default_loadouts = ["helix", "fish"]
follow_symlinks  = false
```

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `default_loadouts` | `[]` | Loadouts (by filename stem) applied to each new session when no `--loadout`/`--no-loadouts` flag is given |
| `follow_symlinks` | `false` | Follow symlinks while enumerating loadout patch sources. Turn on when your dotfile tree is a symlink farm (stow, chezmoi) and you want the walk to descend through the links |

A missing file is equivalent to the defaults; unknown keys are rejected so
a typo (`[loadout]` for `[loadouts]`) fails loudly.

### Session keys {#session-keys}

The detach chord is configurable. The leader key (the chord that enters
command mode) and its command-mode subcommand keys live under a
`[session-keys]` section in the same `config.toml`:

```toml
[session-keys]
leader = "ctrl-]"
bell_on_leader = false

[session-keys.subcommands]
detach = "d"
forward = "ctrl-]"
```

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `leader` | `ctrl-]` | The chord that enters command mode, as a logical key name (`"ctrl-]"`, `"ctrl-^"`, `"d"`, …). Rejected loudly at load if termios-special (`ctrl-c`, `ctrl-w`, `ctrl-\`, … — consumed by the line discipline before the app) or wrapping-ambiguous (`ctrl-i` = TAB, `ctrl-m` = CR, …) |
| `bell_on_leader` | `false` | Ring the terminal bell (BEL `0x07`) on entering command mode. The terminal renders it per its own bell config; minimal picks no modality |
| `subcommands.detach` | `d` | The command-mode key that detaches the channel |
| `subcommands.forward` | `ctrl-]` | The command-mode key that verbatim-forwards a leader byte down the PTY (for nested sessions). Defaults to the resolved `leader`, so a double-press forwards |

The leader is negotiated with the daemon per attach channel — sent as env
vars alongside `MINIMAL_SESSION_ID` — so two clients with different configs on
the same session each get their own chord. The daemon re-validates the leader
as a silent backstop: a chord it rejects is logged and falls back to the
default rather than garbling the screen. As with `[loadouts]`, every field
defaults and unknown keys are rejected, so an old config keeps parsing.

## Listing loadouts

[`min loadout list`](./cli-min.md#loadout-list-alias-ls) (alias:
`min loadout ls`) enumerates every `*.toml` file in the loadouts
directory, one row per file:

```
  NAME               DESCRIPTION                       CONTRIBUTES
* dev                helix + zellij with my dotfiles   2 pkg / 4 var / 5 patch
  extra                                                1 pkg / 0 var / 0 patch
  default (built-in) orientation banner and shaped prompt  0 pkg / 3 var / 0 patch

  default (built-in) applied when no loadouts are configured
* default (from `[loadouts].default_loadouts`)
```

- Loadouts named in `default_loadouts` are marked with a leading `*`.
- The [built-in `default` loadout](#built-in-default-loadout) is listed as a
  `default (built-in)` row unless a user `default.toml` shadows it.
- Malformed entries are listed with their parse error so they can be fixed
  in place; a `default_loadouts` entry with no matching file produces a
  warning.
- `--dir <DIR>` overrides the loadouts directory.

## Composition, conflicts, and policy

At activation, the client composes the selected loadouts into a single
contribution and ships it to the daemon, where it is merged with the
project's contribution (the `[session]` block of the project's
`minimal.toml`, plus per-package contributions) into the session's final
configuration. Merge semantics across all contributors:

- **Packages** deduplicate: set semantics, there is no value to disagree
  on.
- **Vars** with the same name and the same resolved value deduplicate.
  The same name with *different* values is a hard conflict that fails the
  composition; there is no override precedence between loadouts and the
  project. The error's hint applies: add the name to your policy's
  `ignore` list to drop all contributors of that variable.
- **Patches** with the same destination and different sources are likewise
  a conflict.
- **Lifecycle hooks** concatenate in declaration order (execution is not
  yet wired up in the current release).

Two loadouts with the same name cannot be applied together.

Loadout contributions are gated by the user's policy
(`<config>/minimal/user_policy.toml`): items you declare yourself
automatically pass the `allow` check, but the policy's `deny` and `ignore`
rules still apply: a loadout patch matching a `deny` pattern fails the
composition on the client, before the daemon is involved. A missing policy
file means an empty policy; a fresh install activates fine without it.

## Vars in the attach shell

The interactive shell minted by [`min session attach`](./cli-min.md#session-attach) is
`bash --noprofile -l`, a login shell that sources **no** startup files
(not `/etc/profile`, `~/.bash_profile`, or `~/.bashrc`), so rc-file
patches cannot influence it. Interactive setup travels through the
environment instead, i.e. through `[vars]`:

- **Prompt**: the session launcher seeds a baseline environment
  (a stock `PS1`, plus the [orientation banner](#orientation-banner)
  vars below) before merging in the composed vars, and a composed var
  overwrites a baseline entry with the same name. Setting `PS1` in
  `[vars]` therefore replaces the stock prompt. This baseline is
  a layer *beneath* composition, not a contributor: the no-override
  conflict rule above arbitrates between contributors and does not apply
  to the launcher's defaults.
- **Banner / MOTD**: bash evaluates `PROMPT_COMMAND` from the
  environment before the first interactive prompt, so a once-only banner
  can ship as a payload var plus a self-unsetting trigger:

  ```toml
  [vars]
  PROMPT_COMMAND = 'eval "$MINIMAL_MOTD"; unset PROMPT_COMMAND MINIMAL_MOTD'
  MINIMAL_MOTD   = '''
  [ -t 1 ] && printf '%s\n' '' '  Welcome to the dev session.' ''
  '''
  ```

  The trigger unsets both variables, so the banner prints exactly once
  and never runs for non-interactive commands; the `[ -t 1 ]` guard keeps
  redirected output clean. Multi-line literal values survive composition
  intact.

### Orientation banner {#orientation-banner}

Unless a loadout overrides it, the first interactive prompt of an
attached session prints a two-line orientation banner:

```
minimal · session api-server-4f2a · loadout default (built-in)
detach: ctrl-] then d · no minimal.toml here — min init to add one
```

The second line drops the `min init` pointer when the session workspace
carries a `minimal.toml` (either layout, `minimal.toml` or
`.minimal/minimal.toml`) — the template tests the workspace root
(`/workbench`) in-shell at the moment it prints, so the clause reflects
the session's actual filesystem: it stays correct when an activation
skipped the file upload, and disappears after an in-session `min init`
once a fresh shell launches. The banner is TTY-gated, prints exactly
once, and is plain text (`NO_COLOR`-safe).

It ships as a *static template* in the launcher baseline (the MOTD
recipe above), interpolated by the shell at print time from two env
vars every session carries:

| Var | Value |
|-----|-------|
| `MINIMAL_SESSION_NAME` | The session's name |
| `MINIMAL_LOADOUTS` | Display list of the active loadouts: comma-joined names, `default (built-in)` for the zero-config fallback, `none` with `--no-loadouts` |

Both are seeded daemon-side in the launcher baseline; the loadout list
travels from the client as a first-class field on the composition
(control-plane data, never a session var), so user vars and user policy
cannot collide with either.

Because the trigger lives in the baseline layer, a loadout that sets its
own `PROMPT_COMMAND` replaces the banner cleanly — and can interpolate
the same `$MINIMAL_*` vars in its own MOTD, as the built-in `default`
loadout does for its orientation lines.
