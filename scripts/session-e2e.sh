#!/usr/bin/env bash
# The ONE session e2e, invoked by every target lane. Drives the real user
# path through the `min` CLI — which abstracts where the daemon lives —
# so the IDENTICAL proof runs against all three deployment targets:
#
#   Linux native   minimald on the host          (no extra env)
#   Linux KVM      minimald in a minvmd microVM  E2E_VM=1 E2E_MINIMAL_ARGS="--provider local-minvmd"
#   macOS HVF      minimald in a minvmd microVM  E2E_VM=1 (macOS is always VM-backed)
#
# Two proofs, in order, on EVERY lane:
#
#  1. Lifecycle: from a guaranteed-clean state, `min session activate` must auto-spawn
#     the target's daemon and create a session; then list, warm-call, destroy
#     (verified delisted), and a clean `min stop` that the next command
#     auto-respawns from.
#
#  2. Session sandbox: with the session live, attach an INTERACTIVE shell —
#     which forks a real hakoniwa sandbox (on a VM lane, inside the guest, over
#     the vsock bridge) — and prove the in-sandbox `min` helper. Inside the
#     sandbox we `min add <tool>` a package that is NOT in the launcher
#     baseline (base/coreutils/socat), then run it: the tool being absent
#     before and runnable after proves `min add` reached the daemon over the
#     in-sandbox `/run/minenv_sock` relay and hardlinked the package into the
#     live rootfs. This is lane-agnostic: it operates on the session workspace,
#     not the host project, so the identical attach+add+run runs everywhere.
#     Timing is reported but NOT asserted.
#
#     A session is interactive by design, so we drive it like a real user
#     through a REAL pty (scripts/e2e-attach-pty.py) rather than a pipe: pump
#     the command stream, then, when the shell exits and the daemon shows its
#     Detach/Delete prompt, answer it with keystrokes (Down + Enter => Delete).
#     A pipe is not a tty and could not answer that prompt. Selecting Delete
#     tears the session down, so it must be delisted afterwards. The same daemon
#     prompt runs whether local or in-guest, so the pty driver covers every lane.
#
# Host-side project seed: `min session activate` runs client-side and, since #758,
# BAILS (rather than scaffolding over an existing config) when the target dir
# has no `minimal.toml` and stdin is non-interactive; and since #748 it UPLOADS
# the project dir into the session. So we activate a small, self-seeded dir
# carrying the repo's own pinned `[upstream]` + a light `shell` stack — never
# the repo root (uploading the whole tree, and scaffolding over its
# `.minimal/minimal.toml`, is the clobber #758 prevents). On the VM lanes the
# caller passes E2E_PROJECT_DIR=/tmp; we seed a small subdir under it so the
# upload stays small. Every seed we create is removed on teardown.
#
# VM targets (E2E_VM=1) additionally need, from the caller:
#   - a codesigned/linkable `minvmd` on PATH (min spawns it by name)
#   - MINVMD_KERNEL_PATH / MINVMD_ROOTFS_PATH / MINVMD_INITRAMFS
#     (propagate through the `minvmd run --detach` re-exec)
#   - MINVMD_BOOT_LOG (optional) to override the guest-console capture path
#
# Environment:
#   E2E_MINIMAL_ARGS    global args for every `min` call (e.g. --provider local-minvmd)
#   E2E_PROJECT_DIR     project to activate (default: a self-seeded throwaway
#                       dir; VM lanes pass /tmp)
#   E2E_ACTIVATE_ARGS   extra args for `min session activate` (e.g. a future
#                       `--loadout dev` once the loadouts CLI lands, #686)
#   E2E_VM              set to 1 for VM-backed targets (extra teardown +
#                       diagnostics: minvmd stop, guest boot log)
#
# Usage: scripts/session-e2e.sh
set -uo pipefail # not -e: capture failures so we can dump diagnostics
